## Communication

- Communication
is the process of conveying information and meaning. 
- True communication takes place
only when all parties understand the message (information) from the same perspective
(meaning).

### Communication and Leadership

- Managers spend around 40 percent of their time communicating.
- Leadership is
about influencing others, and we do so through communications.
- Leadership is
also about building relationships, which is also based on communications. 
- Thus,
there is a positive relationship between communication competency and leader-
ship performance.
- Organizations are training employees to communicate better
to influence others to get their jobs done.

### Sending Messages and Giving Instructions

#### Before sending a message, we should plan it, remembering that brevity rules. 
#### Answer these questions while planning. 
   + What is the goal of my message? 
   + Who should receive my message? 
   + When will my message be transmitted? 
   + Where will my message be transmitted?
   + How will I send the message?
   
#### The Oral Message-Sending Process
   + develop rapport; 
   + state your communication objective; 
   + transmit your message; 
   + check the receiverâ€™s understanding; and 
   + get a commitment and follow up. 
   
## Managing Conflict

- Poor communications, and feedback, can lead to conflict. 
- A conflict exists
whenever people are in disagreement and opposition. 
- Conflict is part of everyday life in
organizations;53 it affects everyone involved and how we manage conflict affects performance.
- With the trend toward teamwork, conflict skills are increasingly important; as managers spend about 25 percent of their time resolving conflicts.
- Thus, ability to resolve conflicts will have a direct effect on your leadership success.

## The Psychological Contract
- All human relations rely on the psychological contract. 
- The psychological contract is the
unwritten implicit expectations of each party in a relationship. 
- At work, you have a set of
expectations of what you will contribute to the organization (effort, time, skills) and what
it will provide to you (compensation, job satisfaction, etc.). 
- We are often not aware of our expectations until they have not been met (for example, how we are treated by a manager).

### Conflict Arises by Breaking the Psychological Contract

The psychological contract is broken for two primary reasons:

- (1) We fail to make explicit our own expectations and fail to inquire into the expectations of the other parties; and/ or 
- (2) we further assume that the other party(ies) has the same expectations that we hold.

--> To help form the psychological contract, organizations have values, norms, and rules to
guide fair and legitimate behaviour.

--> Conflict Can Be Dysfunctional or Functional
