## Komunikasi

- Communication is the process of conveying information and meaning. 
- True communication takes place
only when all parties understand the message (information) from the same perspective
(meaning).

### Komunikasi dan Kepemimpinan

- Managers spend around 40 percent of their time communicating.
- Leadership is about influencing others, and we do so through communications.
- Leadership is also about building relationships, which is also based on communications. 
- Thus, there is a positive relationship between communication competency and leader-
ship performance.
- Organizations are training employees to communicate better to influence others to get their jobs done.

### Mengirim Pesan dan Memberikan Instruksi

#### Sebelum mengirim pesan, kita harus merancang pesan dengan baik, singkat dan padat: 

   + What is the goal of my message? 
   + Who should receive my message? 
   + When will my message be transmitted? 
   + Where will my message be transmitted?
   + How will I send the message?
   
#### Proses menyampaikan pesan secara lisan
   + develop rapport; 
   + state your communication objective; 
   + transmit your message; 
   + check the receiverâ€™s understanding; and 
   + get a commitment and follow up. 
   
## Mengelola Konflik

- Poor communications, and feedback, can lead to conflict. 
- A conflict exists whenever people are in disagreement and opposition. 
- Conflict is part of everyday life in organizations; it affects everyone involved and how we manage conflict affects performance.
- With the trend toward teamwork, conflict skills are increasingly important; as managers spend about 25 percent of their time resolving conflicts.
- Thus, ability to resolve conflicts will have a direct effect on your leadership success.

## Kontrak Psikologis

- All human relations rely on the psychological contract. 
- The psychological contract is the unwritten implicit expectations of each party in a relationship. 
- At work, you have a set of expectations of what you will contribute to the organization (effort, time, skills) and what it will provide to you (compensation, job satisfaction, etc.). 
- We are often not aware of our expectations until they have not been met (for example, how we are treated by a manager).

### Konflik Timbul karena Pelanggaran Kontrak Psikologis:

- We fail to make explicit our own expectations and fail to inquire into the expectations of the other parties; and/ or 
- We further assume that the other party(ies) has the same expectations that we hold.

--> To help form the psychological contract, organizations have values, norms, and rules to
guide fair and legitimate behaviour.

--> Konflik dapat Dysfunctional atau Functional
